4. **Make sure it loads properly**
   * Press the **"Disable"** button
   * If status changes from **"Unknown"**, script was loaded correctly
   * If not, simply reload one more time
5. **Join any match**
6. **Activate when needed:** as soon as votekick starts against you, press **"Enable"** button
7. **Done, now you can rejoin the match even after votekick**

**[UPDATE V1.5] 20.06**
- Small improvements.

**[UPDATE V1.4] 16.06**
- Fixed an issue that may cause a crash when the network connection was unstable.

**[UPDATE V1.3] 14.06**
- The script now **automatically** enables Windows Firewall before applying changes. If it failed to work previously, or if you are using a tweaked OS, launch the script, wait 10 seconds and reboot.
- Fixed an issue preventing the menu from closing if you had a different keybind for it.
